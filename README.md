Users should be able to:

-  View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
-  See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-  See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
-  Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My Process

### Built With

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  CSS Custom properties
-  Flexbox
-  CSS Grid
-  Mobile First Workflow
-  [React](https://reactjs.org/)
-  [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For Styles
-  [react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org);
-  [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com)

### What I learned

-  One of the major things i learned in this project was how to use the styled components library with React
-  I also learned how to use the leafletjs and react-leaflet library for generating the maps on the website

```js
// STYLED COMPONENTS
const Wrapper = styled.section`
	width: 100vw;
	position: absolute;
	top: 0;
	/* border: 1px solid black; */
	padding: 1.5rem 0;

	.section-center {
		/* border: 1px solid black; */
		display: flex;
		flex-direction: column;
```
